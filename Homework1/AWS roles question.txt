Q: Assume you have IAM Role attached to EC2 instance, and nothing in environment variables 
or .~/aws/config file. Where awscli / sdk finds secret key and access key?


A: call an AWS STS API to get the temporary credentials, and then use them explicitly to make calls to AWS services,
by retrieving security credentials from Instance Metadata - An application on the instance retrieves the security credentials provided by the role from the instance metadata item iam/security-credentials/role-name.
The application is granted the permissions for the actions and resources that you've defined for the role through the security credentials associated with the role.
These security credentials are temporary and we rotate them automatically.
